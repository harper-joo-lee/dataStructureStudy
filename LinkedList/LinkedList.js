// Linked Lists
// Linlked lists aren't in contiguous places in memory, they can be all over the place.
// Linked lists also have a variable called head that points to the first item and one called tail that points to the 
// lst item, then each item in the linked list points to the next, to the next, to the next.
// and the last one points null.
